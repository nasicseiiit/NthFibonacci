When n = 5
1, 1, 2, 3, 5

#Prime Number

Write a programme to find a number is prime number or not

#Requirements

Please install python 3 and above

#Installation

First, clone NthFibonacciAndIsItPrime using git

_`git clone https://github.com/nasicseiiit/NthFibonacciAndIsItPrime`_

# To build the project

Then, cd to the NthFibonacciAndIsItPrime folder 

 cd NthFibonacciAndIsItPrime/
 
 sudo python setup.py install
 
#To run the project

 cd NthFibonacciAndIsItPrime/
 
 cd to the values folder in app
 
 cd app/values
 
 then execute below command for to get FibanacciSeries
 
 python FibanacciSeries.py
 
 then execute below command for to know whether the number is prime or not PrimeNumbers.py 
 
 python PrimeNumbers.py

#Example

`generateFibanacciSeries(1) #returns 1`

`generateFibanacciSeries(5) #returns [1,1,2,3,5]`


`isItPrime(5) #returns It is a prime number`

`isItPrime(8) #returns It is not a prime number`
